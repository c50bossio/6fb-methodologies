# Claude Code Cost Optimization Guide
## Target: $0.02-0.04 per session

### üìä Cost Breakdown by Model

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Best Use Case |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | Complex analysis, code generation |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.25 | $1.25 | Simple reviews, triage, quick responses |

### üéØ Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Smart Model Selection
- **Haiku** for: Issue triage, simple reviews, dependency analysis
- **Sonnet** for: Security analysis, complex performance reviews, architecture decisions

#### 2. Token Management
- **Max tokens**: 8192 for comprehensive analysis, 4096 for focused reviews
- **Context limiting**: Exclude large files, node_modules, build artifacts
- **Smart truncation**: Focus on changed files only

#### 3. Trigger Optimization
- **File count limits**: Skip PR reviews with >20 changed files
- **Pattern matching**: Only trigger expensive analysis for critical file changes
- **Scheduled scans**: Weekly security audits instead of every commit

#### 4. Session Control
- **Max turns**: Limit to 3 interactions per session
- **Timeouts**: 10-minute session limits
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent concurrent expensive operations

### üí∞ Cost Monitoring

#### Daily Budget Allocation
- **PR Reviews**: $0.10/day (5 reviews @ $0.02 each)
- **Security Scans**: $0.20/week (1 comprehensive scan)
- **Performance Analysis**: $0.15/week (3 analyses @ $0.05 each)
- **Issue Triage**: $0.05/day (5 issues @ $0.01 each)

#### Weekly Budget: ~$1.50
- **Daily average**: ~$0.21
- **Per session target**: $0.02-0.04
- **Peak usage**: $0.30/day (during heavy development)

### üìà Usage Tracking

#### Metrics to Monitor
- Cost per workflow execution
- Token usage by analysis type
- Success rate of cost optimizations
- Most expensive operations

#### Alerts Setup
- **Daily spend > $0.50**: Review usage patterns
- **Single session > $0.10**: Investigate cause
- **Weekly spend > $2.00**: Adjust optimization settings

### üîß Configuration Optimizations

#### Context Reduction
```yaml
context:
  max_file_size: 10000      # Skip large files
  exclude_patterns:
    - "node_modules/**"
    - ".next/**"
    - "*.log"
    - "*.map"
```

#### Smart Triggers
```yaml
triggers:
  pr_review:
    max_files: 20           # Cost control
    min_files: 1            # Efficiency
```

#### Model Fallbacks
```yaml
model_selection:
  primary: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
  fallback: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"
  cost_threshold: 0.05
```

### üöÄ Best Practices

#### 1. Batch Operations
- Group related analyses in single sessions
- Use workflow dependencies to avoid redundant runs

#### 2. Cache Results
- Remember analysis results for unchanged files
- Reuse security findings across similar PRs

#### 3. Progressive Analysis
- Start with quick Haiku scan
- Escalate to Sonnet only for high-priority issues

#### 4. User Education
- Encourage specific @claude commands
- Guide users to focus requests on specific files/areas

### üìã Cost-Effective Commands

#### High-Value, Low-Cost
- `@claude triage` - Quick issue labeling ($0.01)
- `@claude quick-review` - Basic PR scan ($0.02)
- `@claude security-check` - Focused security scan ($0.03)

#### Medium-Value, Medium-Cost
- `@claude performance-review` - Component analysis ($0.04)
- `@claude api-security` - API endpoint analysis ($0.05)

#### High-Value, High-Cost (Use Sparingly)
- `@claude comprehensive-review` - Full codebase analysis ($0.08)
- `@claude architecture-review` - System design analysis ($0.10)

### üéõÔ∏è Emergency Cost Controls

#### Circuit Breakers
- **Daily limit**: $1.00 (auto-disable after threshold)
- **Session limit**: $0.10 (escalation required)
- **Concurrent limit**: 2 expensive operations max

#### Manual Overrides
- **Critical security**: Budget exemption for security findings
- **Production issues**: Emergency analysis without limits
- **Deployment failures**: Priority debugging regardless of cost

### üìä ROI Justification

#### Value Delivered
- **Security**: Prevent costly vulnerabilities ($1000+ saved per finding)
- **Performance**: Improve user experience (conversion rate impact)
- **Code Quality**: Reduce technical debt (developer productivity)
- **Deployment**: Faster, more reliable releases

#### Cost Comparison
- **Traditional code review**: $50-100/hour (senior developer)
- **Security audit**: $200-500/hour (security consultant)
- **Claude Code**: $0.02-0.04 per comprehensive analysis

### üîÑ Continuous Optimization

#### Weekly Reviews
- Analyze cost patterns
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Adjust trigger thresholds
- Update model selection rules

#### Monthly Analysis
- ROI assessment
- Budget reallocation
- Feature usage patterns
- Cost trend analysis
