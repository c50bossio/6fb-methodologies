# Implementation Plan: 6FB Workbook Deep Analysis & Gap Resolution

**Branch**: `001-deep-analysis-6fb` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-deep-analysis-6fb/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Transform the 6FB Workshop Workbook system from a basic authentication shell into a fully functional interactive learning platform. The implementation addresses 7 critical gaps including workshop content delivery, audio transcription integration, complete note-taking system, live session management, export/sharing capabilities, mobile optimization, and real-time collaboration features.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 18+, Next.js 14 with App Router
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, JWT, Zustand, Socket.io, OpenAI Whisper API
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys, AWS S3 for audio files
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design for mobile)
**Project Type**: web - Next.js full-stack application
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <30s audio transcription, <500ms search response, 99.9% uptime
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 latency, mobile audio recording compatibility, 70% workshop completion rate
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ users, 6 workshop modules, real-time collaboration features

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: PASS - Constitution file contains template placeholders only, no specific constraints to evaluate.

**Notes**:
- No specific constitutional principles defined in current template
- Standard software engineering best practices will be applied
- Focus on maintainable, scalable, and secure implementation

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure (Next.js full-stack with App Router)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research OpenAI Whisper API integration patterns for audio transcription
   - Research Socket.io implementation for real-time features
   - Research audio recording best practices for mobile browsers
   - Research rich text editor libraries for note-taking
   - Research export/sharing patterns for user-generated content

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research OpenAI Whisper API for audio transcription in Next.js applications"
   Task: "Find best practices for Socket.io in Next.js for real-time collaboration"
   Task: "Research mobile audio recording compatibility and fallback strategies"
   Task: "Find best practices for rich text editors in React applications"
   Task: "Research user data export patterns and sharing mechanisms"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technology choices and implementation patterns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - WorkshopModule, WorkshopLesson, WorkbookUser entities
   - TranscriptionRecord, AudioRecording entities
   - WorkbookNote, NoteTag entities
   - LiveSession, SessionParticipant entities
   - UserProgress, ModuleCompletion entities

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Workshop content APIs (modules, lessons, progress)
   - Audio transcription APIs (upload, process, retrieve)
   - Note management APIs (CRUD, search, export)
   - Live session APIs (create, join, interact)
   - User management and authentication APIs

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - User completes workshop module
   - User records and transcribes audio
   - User creates and searches notes
   - User joins live session

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for Claude Code
   - Add workbook-specific context and patterns
   - Update with new API contracts and data models

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Priority order: P0 (Critical) → P1 (High) → P2 (Medium) → P3 (Low)
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
1. Database schema and models (5-7 tasks)
2. API contract tests (8-10 tasks)
3. Core workshop content system (6-8 tasks)
4. Audio transcription system (4-6 tasks)
5. Note-taking system (4-6 tasks)
6. Live session features (4-6 tasks)
7. Export/sharing system (3-4 tasks)
8. Mobile optimization (2-3 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified. Standard web application architecture with appropriate separation of concerns.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
