# üìä 6FB Methodologies - Production Monitoring & Alerting Guide

## üéØ Monitoring Objectives

Ensure the 6FB Methodologies ticket system maintains:
- **99.9% uptime** during critical sales periods
- **Sub-2 second response times** under normal load
- **Zero revenue loss** from technical failures
- **Proactive issue detection** before user impact
- **Comprehensive business intelligence** for optimization

## üö® Critical Alert Categories

### üî¥ **Critical Alerts** (Immediate Response - 5 min SLA)
Revenue-impacting issues requiring immediate attention:

#### Payment System Failures
```javascript
// Alert: Payment success rate drops below 95%
{
  metric: "stripe_payment_success_rate",
  threshold: 0.95,
  duration: "2m",
  priority: "critical",
  escalation: ["engineering_lead", "product_manager", "cto"]
}
```

#### Inventory Overselling
```javascript
// Alert: Negative inventory detected
{
  metric: "inventory_negative_count",
  threshold: 1,
  duration: "immediate",
  priority: "critical",
  escalation: ["engineering_lead", "operations"]
}
```

#### API Downtime
```javascript
// Alert: API error rate above 5%
{
  metric: "api_error_rate_5xx",
  threshold: 0.05,
