### **Recording Workflow**
1. User clicks "Start Recording" → MediaRecorder begins capture
2. Real-time audio level visualization provides feedback
3. Automatic 30-second chunking prevents data loss
4. "Stop Recording" → Audio saved with session metadata
5. Background transcription (when API keys configured)
6. Notes automatically linked to audio sessions

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User visits `/workbook` → Redirected to login if not authenticated
2. Stripe membership verification determines access level
3. Role-based feature access (Basic/Premium/VIP)
4. Secure session management with automatic renewal
