# Workbook Service Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the consolidated service architecture for the 6FB Methodologies workbook system. The previous overlapping audio services have been replaced with a clean, maintainable architecture following SOLID principles.

## Architecture Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
- **AudioRecordingService**: Handles only audio recording operations
- **TranscriptionService**: Manages audio transcription with provider fallbacks
- **NotesService**: Manages workshop note creation and retrieval
- **SessionService**: Handles workshop session lifecycle management

### Dependency Injection
- Services receive dependencies through constructor injection
- ServiceContainer manages service instantiation and dependencies
- Easy to mock services for testing
- Configurable logging and external dependencies

### Interface Segregation
- Clear interfaces define service contracts
- Services depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Easy to swap implementations or add new providers

### Open/Closed Principle
- Services are open for extension (new transcription providers)
- Closed for modification (core service logic)
- Provider pattern allows adding new transcription services

## Service Layer Structure

```
src/lib/services/
├── interfaces.ts              # Service contracts and types
├── AudioRecordingService.ts   # Audio recording implementation
├── TranscriptionService.ts    # Transcription with fallbacks
├── NotesService.ts           # Note management
├── SessionService.ts         # Session lifecycle
├── ServiceContainer.ts       # Dependency injection container
└── index.ts                  # Centralized exports and examples
```

## Key Features

### Unified Error Handling
- Consistent `ServiceResult<T>` pattern across all services
- Standardized error codes and messages
- No throwing exceptions - all errors returned as results

### Provider Fallback System
- Primary transcription provider with fallback options
- Automatic retry logic with different providers
- Health checking for provider availability

### Comprehensive Linking
- Sessions can link to recordings, transcriptions, and notes
- Notes can link to audio recordings and transcriptions
- Maintains referential integrity across services

### High-Level Orchestration
- `ServiceContainer` provides workflow methods
- `startRecordingForSession()` - integrated recording workflow
- `stopRecordingAndProcess()` - complete recording-to-note pipeline
- `getSessionWithContent()` - fetch session with all linked content

## Eliminated Issues

### ❌ Previous Problems
- Circular dependencies between audio services
- Mixed responsibilities in single files
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Hard-coded service dependencies
- Overlapping transcription implementations

### ✅ Current Solutions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection container
- Standardized error handling
- Configurable service dependencies
- Single transcription service with provider fallbacks

## Usage Examples

### Basic Recording Workflow
```typescript
import { services } from '@/lib/services'

// Start recording
const recording = await services.audioRecording.startRecording({
  quality: 'high',
  enableVoiceActivityDetection: true
})

// Stop and get result
const result = await services.audioRecording.stopRecording()
```

### Complete Workshop Session
```typescript
// Create and start session
const session = await services.session.createSession({
  userId: 'user123',
  type: 'workshop',
  title: '6FB Day 1 - Foundation',
  metadata: { day: 1, speaker: 'Chris Bossio' }
})

await services.session.startSession(session.data.id)

// Integrated recording workflow
await services.startRecordingForSession(session.data.id)

// Complete processing workflow
await services.stopRecordingAndProcess(
  session.data.id,
  'user123',
  'Session insights'
)
```

### Custom Configuration
```typescript
import { createServiceContainer } from '@/lib/services'

const customServices = createServiceContainer({
  transcription: {
    provider: 'openai',
    fallbackProviders: ['azure', 'google']
  },
  dependencies: {
    logger: customLogger,
    storage: customStorage
  }
})
```

## Service Configuration

### AudioRecordingService
- Quality settings (high/standard/background)
- Voice activity detection
- Noise suppression and echo cancellation
- Automatic gain control
- Maximum recording duration limits

### TranscriptionService
- Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Azure, Google, local)
- Automatic fallback on provider failure
- Speaker identification support
- Cost tracking and optimization
- Language and format configuration

### NotesService
- Full-text search capabilities
- Category and tag filtering
- Date range filtering
- Link management with recordings/transcriptions
- User and session indexing

### SessionService
- Session lifecycle management
- Progress tracking
- Multi-session support with conflict prevention
- Comprehensive linking to all related content
- Statistics and dashboard data

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// React hook example
function useWorkbookServices() {
  return {
    recording: services.audioRecording,
    transcription: services.transcription,
    notes: services.notes,
    sessions: services.session,
    // High-level workflows
    startRecordingForSession: services.startRecordingForSession,
    stopAndProcess: services.stopRecordingAndProcess
  }
}
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// API route example
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { sessionId, userId, title } = await request.json()

  const result = await services.stopRecordingAndProcess(
    sessionId,
    userId,
    title
  )

  return Response.json(result)
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each service can be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies through ServiceContainer
- Standardized error scenarios

### Integration Testing
- Test service interactions through ServiceContainer
- Verify linking between services
- Test workflow orchestration methods

### Example Test Setup
```typescript
import { createServiceContainer } from '@/lib/services'

const testServices = createServiceContainer({
  dependencies: {
    logger: jest.fn(),
    storage: mockStorage,
    apiClient: mockApiClient
  }
})
```

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Implementation
1. **Remove deleted files** - The old audio services are already deleted
2. **Update imports** - Change imports to use new service structure
3. **Update components** - Use ServiceContainer instead of direct service imports
4. **Add error handling** - Update to use ServiceResult pattern
5. **Configure providers** - Set up transcription provider credentials

### Breaking Changes
- Service methods now return `ServiceResult<T>` instead of throwing
- Service instantiation moved to ServiceContainer
- Different method signatures for consistency

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Persistent storage adapter (database integration)
- Real-time transcription streaming
- Advanced speaker identification
- Audio processing pipeline (noise reduction, normalization)
- Collaborative session support
- Export/import functionality

### Extension Points
- Additional transcription providers
- Custom audio processing plugins
- Alternative storage backends
- Custom authentication systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Audio recordings stored securely
- Transcription data encrypted in transit
- User data isolation
- Configurable data retention policies

### API Security
- Provider API keys managed securely
- Request rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for compliance

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- Chunked audio recording to prevent memory issues
- Lazy loading of transcription results
- Efficient indexing for search operations
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data

### Network Optimization
- Compressed audio upload to transcription services
- Batch operations where possible
- Provider failover to minimize latency
- Caching of frequently accessed data
