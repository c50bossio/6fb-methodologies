# Run complete test suite
npm run test:all

# Build and test Docker image
docker build -t 6fb-workbook:test .
docker run --rm 6fb-workbook:test npm run test:ci

# Performance testing
npm run test:load

# Security scanning
npm audit --audit-level high
```

### 2. Database Preparation (15 minutes)
```bash
# Backup current database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Test migration on copy
createdb workbook_test
psql workbook_test < backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
psql workbook_test -f database/migrations/*.sql

# Verify migration
psql workbook_test -f database/verify-schema.sql
```

### 3. Application Deployment (20 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy using the deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Monitor deployment
tail -f deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-*).log

# Verify health checks
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test critical user flows
npm run test:e2e:user-journey

# Check performance
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3000/

# Verify real-time features
# (Manual test of live sessions and Socket.io)
```
